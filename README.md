# 🚀 Getting Started with LangGraph: A Practical Guide for Building AI Agents

Hello everyone!  
As I've already mentioned, this week I've been studying **LangGraph** to create AI agents. Since I believe this could be useful for many of you, I’m sharing this **mini-summary on how to get started**.

LangGraph allows you to **set up AI agents and processes in a modular way** using graph structures, making communication and architecture more structured and scalable.

## 📚 1. First Steps and Recommended Tutorials

If you want to start with a **basic introduction**, I recommend this YouTube course:  
👉 [LangGraph Tutorial (3 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGg_1h0qzaM&t=6461s)

It covers the core concepts of LangGraph in a clear and practical way.

Once you're familiar with the basics, the **official documentation** is the best next step. It explores more advanced features like **long-term memory persistence**, **human-in-the-loop**, and **MCP**:  
👉 [Official LangGraph Guides](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/guides/%C2%B4)

⚠️ *Tip:* In my opinion, the official documentation assumes you already know the basic concepts, so I strongly recommend going through the first tutorial before diving into advanced topics.

## 🧠 2. Why RAG Is So Useful

Among all the available tools, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is particularly relevant for us.

In the first course I shared, they explain a **basic RAG implementation** at the end — which is more than enough for most use cases.  
If you want to **go deeper** into different RAG types, capabilities, and advanced use cases, here’s another excellent course:  
👉 [Advanced RAG Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVcwVQRHIc8&t=811s)

💡 *Note:* The basic version works perfectly for most situations, but the advanced one is great for a deeper understanding.

Additionally, I’ve created a **small Python script** with helper functions to create and interact with **vector databases**, which I’m happy to share if it’s useful for your projects.

## ⚠️ 3. RAG Disclaimer

Keep in mind:

> RAG performs a **semantic comparison** between the prompt we send (from either a user or an agent) and the texts stored in its **vector database**.

- It returns the **most semantically similar texts**, which provide useful context.  
- If the similarity is **low**, important information might be missed.  

📌 **Best practice:** If some information is critical, always include it **directly in the prompt** — don’t leave it “to the luck of RAG”.

## 🧱 4. LangGraph & LangChain

Remember that LangGraph is **built on top of** LangChain, meaning that:

- All LangChain utilities also work in LangGraph.
- RAG tools belong to LangChain, not LangGraph.

👉 [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/)

## 📨 5. Types of Messages in LangChain

In LangChain (and LLMs in general), systems accept **4 types of messages**:

- 🧭 **System Messages:** Base instructions the model always considers.  
  *Example:* “You are a doctor expert in cardiology…”

- 👤 **Human Messages:** Messages sent by users (or other entities).

- 🤖 **AI Messages:** Responses generated by the LLM to Human Messages.

- 🧰 **Tool Messages:** Responses obtained from calling external tools.

---

## 🤝 6. Special Case: Agent-to-Agent Communication

Imagine we have two agents interacting with each other.  

Although messages are generated as **AI Messages**, when one agent talks to another, the message **must be converted to a Human Message** before being passed on.  

Why?  
If sent as an AI Message, the receiving agent might **misinterpret it as its own previous response**.

In this context:

> “Human Message” should not be understood literally as a message written by a human, but as a **request to the LLM**.

---

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

LangGraph is a **powerful and flexible framework** for building agentic systems.  

As Bret Taylor said:  
> “Today, everyone builds agents however they can — and in 5 years we’ll be embarrassed by how we do it.”

For now, LangGraph is the most popular and standardized way to do it.  
I hope this mini-guide helps you take your **first steps into structured agent development**. 🚀
